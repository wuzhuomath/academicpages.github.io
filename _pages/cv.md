I have created a lots of olympic questions. I always tried to consider some simple situation and assumption, and extension them naturally. Thus, these questions are always beautiful and elegant. Some of these questions are provided for some exams, such as admission exams of Peking University for maths contestants.  Here are some of these questions. If you want to know the answer of these questions, or interested on how can I created these questions, please email me. I'll be very happy if you are interested on my olympic questions.
