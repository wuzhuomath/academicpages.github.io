I am Zhuo Wu, a senior undergraduate student from School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. I love maths, especially for the conciseness and beautiful ideas. I am particularly interested in combinatorics, and I have been working on a variety of discrete problems. Besides, I teach high school maths olympiad in my spare time, and I have written several problems for some competitions. I enjoy the feeling of coming up with elegant problems and write down their nice proofs.
