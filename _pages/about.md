I'm Wu zhuo, A undergraduate student from Peking University. I love math, and I enjoy beautiful and simple math. I am highly interested in combinatorics, and I have always been working on various discrete problems. Besides, I am also a math olympic teacher, and I have created many original problems for the some exams. I enjoy the feeling of creating elegant problems. This is my simple homepage, And I will show my writtings here. Maybe the writtings are poorly written, but I will update them.
