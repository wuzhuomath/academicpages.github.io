I have created some olympiad problems. I always try to start from some simple situations and assumptions, and then extend them naturally.  Most of these problems were provided to some exams, such as the admission exams of Peking University for high school maths contestants. My favorite problems are collected here. If you want to know the answers of them, or if you are interested in how I came up with such problems, just email me. I will be very happy to discuss them with you.
