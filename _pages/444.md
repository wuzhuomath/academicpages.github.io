Here are my writtings.

[On the stability of graph independence number](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13306.pdf)
---
In this paper, we researched the independence number stability problem, which concerns the behavior of the independence number of some graph given that the independence number does not drop after deleting any small subset of vertices. Besides, we proved the sharp upper bound of the independence number of a graph given that the independence number does not drop after deleting any vertex, which was previously a conjecture of Prof. Boris Bukh.


[A complicated Inequality Problem](https://wuzhuomath.github.io/files/Inequality.pdf)
---
It is a complicated inequality problem from some research on Ramsey theory conducted by Debsoumya Chakraborti and Po-shen Loh, and finally I worked the problem out.

[Undergraduate Research](https://wuzhuomath.github.io/files/Undergraduate%20Research.pdf)
---
It is my undergraduate research paper, which discusses the problem about the common subsequences of unequal length sequences. Considering the purpose of writing, the paper is written in chinese.

[An Inverted Problem of Boros and F{\"u}redi(Unifinished version)](https://wuzhuomath.github.io/files/Undergraduate%20Research.pdf)
---
Boros and F{\"u}redi proved that for any finite set of points in the plane in general position there is a point lying in $\frac{2}{9}$ of all the triangles determined by these points. We consider an inverted version of this problem.
