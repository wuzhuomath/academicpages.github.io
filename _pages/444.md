Here are my writtings.

[On the stability of graph independence number](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13306.pdf)
---
In this paper, we researched the independence number stability problem, which concerns the behavior of the independence number of some graph given that the independence number does not drop after deleting any small subset of vertices. Besides, we proved the sharp upper bound of the independence number of a graph given that the independence number does not drop after deleting any vertex, which was previously a conjecture of Prof. Boris Bukh.


[A complicated Inequality Problem](https://wuzhuomath.github.io/files/Inequality.pdf)
---
It is a complicated inequality problem from some research on Ramsey theory conducted by Debsoumya Chakraborti and Po-shen Loh, and finally I worked the problem out.

[Undergraduate Research](https://wuzhuomath.github.io/files/Undergraduate%20Research.pdf)
---
It is my undergraduate research paper, which discusses the problem about the common subsequences of unequal length sequences. Considering the purpose of writing, the paper is written in chinese.

[An Inverted Problem of Boros and Furedi(Unfinished version)](https://wuzhuomath.github.io/files/geometry.pdf)
---
We consider an inverted problem of boros and Furedi and give a simple extension to this problem. Because the current result is not optimal, the paper is unfinished. The best result will be updated as soon as possible.
